# SOC 2 — Trust Services Criteria Reference

## Overview

SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) is an attestation framework developed by the **AICPA** (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) under the **SSAE 18** (Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 18) standard. It evaluates a service organization's controls relevant to the **Trust Services Criteria (TSC)**, codified in the **2017 Trust Services Criteria** (TSP Section 100).

SOC 2 reports are restricted-use documents intended for customers, regulators, and business partners who need assurance that a service organization operates with adequate controls over its systems and data.

**Key characteristics**:
- Applies to **service organizations** (SaaS providers, data centers, managed service providers, etc.)
- Engagement performed by a licensed **CPA firm**
- Based on **COSO 2013** internal control framework (the CC-series criteria map directly to COSO principles)
- Criteria are **principle-based**, not prescriptive — the organization defines its own controls to satisfy each criterion
- Management describes the system in a **system description** (using DC Section 200 guidelines)

## Five Trust Service Categories

| Category | Code | Required? | Scope |
|----------|------|-----------|-------|
| **Security** | CC (Common Criteria) | Always required | Protection against unauthorized access (logical and physical) |
| **Availability** | A | Optional | System is available for operation and use as committed or agreed |
| **Processing Integrity** | PI | Optional | System processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized |
| **Confidentiality** | C | Optional | Information designated as confidential is protected as committed or agreed |
| **Privacy** | P | Optional | Personal information is collected, used, retained, disclosed, and disposed of in conformity with commitments and criteria |

Security (Common Criteria) is the foundation of every SOC 2 report. The additional categories are selected based on the nature of the service and customer expectations.

## SOC 2 Report Types

| Attribute | Type I | Type II |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Scope** | Design of controls at a point in time | Design and operating effectiveness over a period |
| **Observation period** | Single date (snapshot) | Minimum 3 months (6-12 months recommended); typically 12 months |
| **Auditor testing** | Inquiry and inspection only | Inquiry, inspection, observation, and re-performance |
| **Maturity signal** | Suitable for first-time reports or new systems | Industry standard; expected by enterprise customers |
| **Common use** | Demonstrate control design before a full audit cycle | Provide ongoing assurance of operating effectiveness |

Organizations typically start with a Type I, then transition to Type II for subsequent reporting periods.

---

## SOC 2+ Reports

A **SOC 2+** report layers additional frameworks or regulatory criteria alongside the Trust Services Criteria within a single engagement. The auditor tests the SOC 2 criteria plus the supplemental criteria simultaneously.

**Common SOC 2+ combinations**:

| Additional Framework | Use Case |
|---------------------|----------|
| HITRUST CSF | Healthcare SaaS, business associate agreements |
| ISO 27001 Annex A | International customers requiring ISO alignment |
| CSA CCM v4 | Cloud service providers seeking STAR attestation |
| NIST 800-53 | Federal customers, FedRAMP readiness |
| NIST Cybersecurity Framework | Cross-industry risk management alignment |
| Custom criteria | Specific regulatory or contractual requirements |

The SOC 2+ approach reduces audit fatigue by consolidating multiple assessments into a single engagement with one auditor.

---

## SOC Report Sections

Every SOC 2 report contains four primary sections:

| Section | Author | Contents |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Section I — Management Assertion** | Service organization management | Assertion that the system description is fairly presented and controls are suitably designed (Type I) / suitably designed and operating effectively (Type II) |
| **Section II — Independent Service Auditor's Report** | CPA firm (auditor) | Auditor's opinion: unqualified, qualified, adverse, or disclaimer of opinion |
| **Section III — System Description** | Service organization management | Infrastructure, software, people, procedures, data; boundaries of the system; applicable trust service categories; complementary controls |
| **Section IV — Applicable Trust Services Criteria, Related Controls, Tests of Controls, and Results of Tests** | CPA firm (auditor) | Each criterion, the control(s) addressing it, tests performed (Type II), and test results including any exceptions |

Some reports include a **Section V** with other information provided by the service organization (e.g., future plans, responses to exceptions). This section is not covered by the auditor's opinion.

## SOC 1 vs SOC 2 vs SOC 3

| Attribute | SOC 1 (SSAE 18 / ISAE 3402) | SOC 2 (SSAE 18) | SOC 3 (SSAE 18) |
|-----------|------------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Focus** | Controls relevant to user entities' financial reporting (ICFR) | Controls relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, privacy | Same as SOC 2 |
| **Standard** | AT-C Section 320 | AT-C Section 205 + TSP Section 100 | AT-C Section 205 + TSP Section 100 |
| **Audience** | Restricted (customers, auditors) | Restricted (customers, auditors, regulators) | General use (public) |
| **Detail level** | Full control descriptions and test results | Full control descriptions and test results | Summary-level opinion only; no control detail |
| **Report types** | Type I and Type II | Type I and Type II | No type distinction (always period-based) |
| **Common use** | Payroll processors, financial SaaS, loan servicers | SaaS platforms, data centers, managed services | Marketing and website trust seal |

---

## Bridge Letters (Gap Coverage Letters)

A **bridge letter** (also called a **gap letter**) is a written assertion from service organization management covering the period between the end of the most recent SOC 2 report observation period and the current date.

**Key characteristics**:
- Not an auditor-attested document; it is a management representation
- Typically a 1-2 page letter signed by an executive (CISO, VP of Engineering, or CEO)
- Covers the "gap period" (e.g., if a Type II report covers Jan 1 - Dec 31, 2025, a bridge letter would cover Jan 1, 2026 through the date of the letter)
- Asserts that no material changes have occurred to the system or its controls since the report period ended
- Discloses any significant changes, incidents, or new subservice organizations during the gap period

**When bridge letters are needed**:
- Customer procurement teams requesting current-state assurance
- When the next Type II report is still in progress
- Contract or regulatory requirements specifying maximum gap duration (typically 3-6 months)

## Complementary Controls

SOC 2 reports frequently identify controls that must be implemented by parties other than the service organization itself.

### Complementary User Entity Controls (CUECs)

CUECs are controls that the **customer** (user entity) is responsible for implementing. They are listed in Section III of the SOC 2 report.

**Common CUECs**:

| Area | Example CUEC |
|------|-------------|
| Access management | Customer is responsible for managing its own user accounts, including timely deprovisioning of terminated employees |
| Authentication | Customer is responsible for enforcing MFA for its users accessing the service |
| Data classification | Customer is responsible for classifying data prior to uploading to the system |
| Monitoring | Customer is responsible for reviewing audit logs available within the platform |
| Incident notification | Customer is responsible for promptly notifying the service organization of suspected security incidents |
| Backup verification | Customer is responsible for verifying its data backups and testing restoration |

Failure to implement CUECs can undermine the effectiveness of the service organization's controls and may affect the customer's own audit posture.

### Complementary Subservice Organization Controls (CSOCs)

CSOCs are controls that must be implemented by **subservice organizations** (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) on which the service organization depends.

**Subservice organization handling methods**:

| Method | Description | Impact on Report |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Inclusive method** | Subservice organization's controls are included in the system description and tested by the auditor | Comprehensive but requires subservice organization cooperation |
| **Carve-out method** | Subservice organization's controls are excluded from the system description; only the service organization's monitoring of the subservice organization is tested | Most common; CSOCs are listed as assumptions |

When the carve-out method is used, the report lists CSOCs that must be in place at the subservice organization. The service organization typically satisfies this by obtaining the subservice organization's own SOC 2 report and reviewing it annually.

---

## COSO Alignment

The CC-series criteria map directly to the 17 principles of the **COSO 2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework**:

| CC Group | COSO Component | COSO Principles |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| CC1.1 - CC1.5 | Control Environment | Principles 1-5 |
| CC2.1 - CC2.3 | Information & Communication | Principles 13-15 |
| CC3.1 - CC3.4 | Risk Assessment | Principles 6-9 |
| CC4.1 - CC4.2 | Monitoring Activities | Principles 16-17 |
| CC5.1 - CC5.3 | Control Activities | Principles 10-12 |
| CC6 - CC9 | Additional criteria specific to TSC | Not directly mapped to COSO principles (TSC-specific supplemental criteria for IT-related objectives) |

---

## Scoping and Readiness Considerations

**Pre-audit readiness assessment checklist**:
1. Define the system boundary (which products, services, and infrastructure are in scope)
2. Select applicable Trust Service Categories beyond Security
3. Identify all subservice organizations and determine carve-out vs. inclusive method
4. Perform a gap assessment against the applicable criteria
5. Document all controls and map them to criteria (controls may satisfy multiple criteria)
6. Prepare the system description per DC Section 200 requirements
7. Collect evidence for each control (see Common Evidence table above)
8. Identify and document CUECs and CSOCs
9. Conduct an internal readiness review or pre-assessment
10. Remediate gaps before the observation period begins (for Type II)

**Common audit exceptions**:
- Access reviews not performed at the documented frequency
- Terminated users not deprovisioned within the documented SLA
- Change management procedures bypassed without documented approval
- Incomplete or missing evidence for annual control activities (risk assessments, BCP tests)
- Vendor risk assessments not completed for all in-scope third parties
